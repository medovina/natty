# Sets

Definition.  Let A, B : Set(σ).  A ⊆ B if x ∈ A implies x ∈ B for all x : σ.

Definition.  Let A : Set(σ).  𝒫(A) = {X : Set(σ) | X ⊆ A }.

# Functions

Definition.  For all S : Set(σ) and T : Set(τ) and f : σ → τ, f is a mapping from S to T if f(x) ∈ T for all x : σ with x ∈ S.

Definition.  For all S : Set(σ) and T : Set(τ) and f : σ → τ, f is an injection from S to T if f is a mapping from S to T and for all x, y : σ, if x ∈ S and y ∈ S and f(x) = f(y) then x = y.

Definition.  For all f : σ → τ, f is injective if f is an injection from σ to τ.

Definition. For all S : Set(σ) and T : Set(τ) and f : σ → τ, f is a surjection from S to T if f is a mapping from S to T and for all y : τ, if y ∈ T then there exists some x : σ such that x ∈ S and f(x) = y.

Definition.  For all f : σ → τ, f is surjective if f is a surjection from σ to τ.

Definition. For all S : Set(σ) and T : Set(τ) and f : σ → τ, f is a bijection from S to T if f is an injection from S to T and f is a surjection from S to T.

# Cardinality

Definition.  For all S : Set(σ) and T : Set(τ), S ~ T if there exists some f : σ → τ such that f is a bijection from S to T.

# Cantor's Theorem, Wiedijk #63

Theorem.  Let A : Set(σ).  Then A ≁ 𝒫(A).

Proof.  Suppose that A ~ 𝒫(A).  Then there is some f : σ → Set(σ) such that f is a bijection from A to 𝒫(A).  Let D = {a : σ | a ∈ A and a ∉ f(a) }. Observe that D ⊆ A, and so D ∈ 𝒫(A).  Because f is a surjection from A to 𝒫(A), there is some d : σ such that d ∈ A and f(d) = D.  Suppose that d ∈ D.  Then by the definition of D we see that d ∉ f(d), so d ∉ D, which is a contradiction.  Now suppose that d ∉ D.  Then d ∈ f(d), so d ∈ D, which is a contradiction.  In any case we have a contradiction, and so A ≁ 𝒫(A).
