# Integers: definition

Axiom.  There exists a type ℤ (the integers) with a function z : ℕ ⨯ ℕ → ℤ such that

  a. For all a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ, z(a, b) = z(c, d) if and only if a + d = b + c.  [int_eq_def]
  b. For all x ∈ ℤ, there exist some a, b ∈ ℕ such that x = z(a, b).

Definition.  Let 0 : ℤ = z(0, 0).  Let 1 : ℤ = z(1, 0).

# Integers: addition

Axiom (int_ax_add).  There is a binary operation + : ℤ → ℤ → ℤ such that for all a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ,

    z(a, b) + z(c, d) = z(a + c, b + d).

Axiom.  There is a unary operation − : ℤ → ℤ such that for all a, b ∈ ℕ,

  −z(a, b) = z(b, a).

Definition.  For all i, j ∈ ℤ, i − j = i + (−j).

# Integers: multiplication

Axiom.  There is a binary operation · : ℤ → ℤ → ℤ such that for all a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ,

    z(a, b) · z(c, d) = z(ac + bd, ad + bc).        [int_mul_def]

# Integers: inequalities

Axiom.  There is a relation < : ℤ → ℤ → 𝔹 such that for all a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ,

    z(a, b) < z(c, d) if and only if a + d < b + c.     [int_lt_def]

Definition.  For all i, j ∈ ℤ, i ≤ j iff i < j or i = j.

Definition.  For all i, j ∈ ℤ, we write i > j iff j < i.  We write i ≥ j iff j ≤ i.
