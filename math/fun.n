# Functions

Definition.  For all S : Set(σ) and T : Set(τ) and f : σ → τ, f is a mapping from S to T if f(x) ∈ T for all x ∈ S.

Definition.  For all S : Set(σ) and T : Set(τ) and f : σ → τ, f is an injection from S to T if f is a mapping from S to T and for all x, y ∈ S, if f(x) = f(y) then x = y.

Definition.  For all f : σ → τ, f is injective if f is an injection from σ to τ.

Definition. For all S : Set(σ) and T : Set(τ) and f : σ → τ, f is a surjection from S to T if f is a mapping from S to T and for all y ∈ T, there exists some x ∈ S such that f(x) = y.

Definition.  For all f : σ → τ, f is surjective if f is a surjection from σ to τ.

Definition. For all S : Set(σ) and T : Set(τ) and f : σ → τ, f is a bijection from S to T if f is an injection from S to T and f is a surjection from S to T.

# Relations

Definition.  For all R : σ ⨯ σ → 𝔹, R is reflexive if R(x, x) is true for all x : σ.

Definition.  For all R : σ ⨯ σ → 𝔹, R is symmetric if R(x, y) implies R(y, x) for all x, y : σ.

Definition.  For all R : σ ⨯ σ → 𝔹, R is transitive if R(x, y) and R(y, z) implies R(x, z) for all x, y, z : σ.

Definition.  For all R : σ ⨯ σ → 𝔹, R is an equivalence relation if R is reflexive and R is symmetric and R is transitive.
