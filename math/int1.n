# Bijection between naturals and non-negative integers

Axiom (int_nat_proj). There is a function π : ℤ → ℕ such that for all i ∈ ℤ, if i ≥ 0 then i = z(π(i), 0).

Theorem.  Let i, j ∈ ℤ.

  1. If i ≥ 0 and j ≥ 0 and π(i) = π(j), then i = j.    [int_proj_injective]
  2. If i ≥ 0 and j ≥ 0, then π(i + j) = π(i) + π(j).
  3. If i ≥ 0 and j ≥ 0, then i ≤ j iff π(i) ≤ π(j).       [int_proj_lt]

Proof.

    1. Let i, j ∈ ℤ, and suppose that i ≥ 0 and j ≥ 0 and π(i) = π(j).  Suppose that i ≠ j.  Then z(π(i), 0) ≠ z(π(j), 0), so π(i) + 0 ≠ π(j) + 0 by [int_eq_def], so π(i) ≠ π(j), which is a contradiction.

    2. Let i, j ∈ ℤ, and suppose that i ≥ 0 and j ≥ 0.  Then
    
        z(π(i + j), 0) = i + j                            by [int_nat_proj]
                            = z(π(i), 0) + z(π(j), 0)   by [int_nat_proj]
                            = z(π(i) + π(j), 0)           by [int_ax_add]  .
    
    Then by [int_eq_def] we have π(i + j) + 0 = π(i) + π(j) + 0, so π(i + j) = π(i) + π(j).

    3. Let i, j ∈ ℤ, and suppose that i ≥ 0 and j ≥ 0.  Suppose that π(i) ≤ π(j).  Then π(i) + 0 ≤ 0 + π(j), so z(π(i), 0) ≤ z(π(j), 0) by [int_le].  Then i ≤ j by [int_nat_proj].  Conversely, suppose that i ≤ j.  Then z(π(i), 0) ≤ z(π(j), 0) by [int_nat_proj].  Then π(i) + 0 ≤ 0 + π(j) by [int_le], so π(i) ≤ π(j).

# Mathematical induction on non-negative integers

Theorem (int_induction).  For all S : ℤ → 𝔹, if 0 ∈ S and for all i ∈ ℤ i ≥ 0 and i ∈ S implies i + 1 ∈ S, then for all i ∈ ℤ i ≥ 0 implies i ∈ S.

Proof.  Let S : ℤ → 𝔹, and suppose that 0 ∈ S and for all i ∈ ℤ i ≥ 0 and i ∈ S implies i + 1 ∈ S.  Let T = { n ∈ ℕ | there exists i ∈ ℤ such that i ≥ 0 and i ∈ S and n = π(i) }.  0 = π(0), so 0 ∈ T.  Now let n : ℕ, and suppose that n ∈ T.  Then there exists some i ∈ ℤ such that i ≥ 0 and i ∈ S and n = π(i). So i + 1 ∈ S.  Now, π(i + 1) = π(i) + π(1) = n + 1 = s(n), so s(n) ∈ T.  We have shown that n ∈ T implies s(n) ∈ T for all n ∈ ℕ.  Then T = ℕ by [induction].  Now let i ∈ ℤ, and suppose that i ≥ 0.  Since T = ℕ, there exists j ∈ ℤ such that j ≥ 0 and j ∈ S and π(i) = π(j).  Then by [int_proj_injective] we have i = j, so i ∈ S.

Theorem (int_induction_1).  For all S : ℤ → 𝔹, if 1 ∈ S and for all i ∈ ℤ i ≥ 1 and i ∈ S implies i + 1 ∈ S, then for all i ∈ ℤ i ≥ 1 implies i ∈ S.

Proof.  Let S : ℤ → 𝔹, and suppose that 1 ∈ S and for all i ∈ ℤ i ≥ 1 and i ∈ S implies i + 1 ∈ S.  Let T = { n ∈ ℤ | n + 1 ∈ S }.  Clearly 0 ∈ T.  Now let i ∈ ℤ, and suppose that i ≥ 0 and i ∈ T.  Let j : ℤ = i + 1. Then j ≥ 1 and j ∈ S, so j + 1 ∈ S, so j ∈ T, so i + 1 ∈ T.  So by [int_induction] we know that i ∈ T for all i : ℤ with i ≥ 0.  Now let i : ℤ, and suppose that i ≥ 1.  Then i - 1 ≥ 0, so i - 1 ∈ T, so i ∈ S.

# Well-ordering principle on non-negative integers

Definition.  For all S : ℤ → 𝔹, S is empty iff there is no n : ℤ such that n ∈ S.  S is nonempty iff S is not empty.

Definition.  For all A : ℤ → 𝔹 and a : ℤ, a is a least element of A iff a ∈ A and for all x : ℤ, if x ∈ A then a ≤ x.  a is a greatest element of A iff a ∈ A and for all x : ℤ, if x ∈ A then x ≤ a.

Theorem (int_greatest_unique).  For all A : ℤ → 𝔹 and x, y : ℤ, if x is a greatest element of A, and y is a greatest element of A, then x = y.

Proof.  Let A : ℤ → 𝔹.  Let x, y : ℤ.  Suppose that x is a greatest element of A, and y is a greatest element of A.  Then x ≤ y and y ≤ x.  It follows by [int_le_antisymm] that x = y.

Theorem (int_well_ordered). Let S : ℤ → 𝔹.  Suppose that S is nonempty, and for all i ∈ ℤ, if i ∈ S then i ≥ 0.  Then there exists some m : ℤ such that m is a least element of S.

Proof.  Let S : ℤ → 𝔹, and suppose that S is nonempty and for all i ∈ ℤ, if i ∈ S then i ≥ 0.  Then there exists some j : ℤ such that j ∈ S and j ≥ 0.  Let T = { n ∈ ℕ | there exists i ∈ ℤ such that i ≥ 0 and i ∈ S and n = π(i) }.  By [nat_well_ordered] there is some a : ℕ such that a is a least element of T.  Since a ∈ T, there is some m : ℤ such that m ≥ 0 and m ∈ S and a = π(m).  We will show that m is a least element of S.  Let x : ℤ, and suppose that x ∈ S.  Then x ≥ 0.  Then π(x) ∈ T.  Since a is a least element of T, we know that a ≤ π(x).  So π(m) ≤ π(x), and then m ≤ x by [int_proj_lt].

# Discreteness of integers

Theorem.  Let x, y ∈ ℤ.

    1. It cannot be that x < y < x + 1.     [int_discrete]
    2. x ≤ y if and only if x < y + 1.         [int_discrete_le]
    3. x < y if and only if x + 1 ≤ y.         [int_discrete_lt]

Proof.

    1. Let x, y ∈ ℤ.  Suppose that x < y < x + 1.  Then x − x < y − x < (x + 1) − x, and we deduce that 0 < y − x < 1.  By [int_lt_trans] we know that y − x ≥ 0, and also 1 : ℤ ≥ 0.  Then by [int_proj_lt] π(0) < π(y − x) < π(1), which is a contradiction to [nat_discrete].

    2. Let x, y ∈ ℤ.  First suppose that x ≤ y.  Suppose further that x ≥ y + 1.  Then by [int_le_trans] we deduce that y + 1 ≤ y.  However 1 : ℤ > 0, so by [int_lt_add_right] we know that y + 1 > y + 0 = y.  This is a contradiction.  Second, suppose that x < y + 1.  Suppose further that x > y.  It follows that y < x < y + 1, which is a contradiction to part (1) of this theorem.  So it must be that x ≤ y.

    3. Let x, y ∈ ℤ.  First suppose that x < y.  Suppose further that x + 1 > y.  Then x < y < x + 1, which is a contradiction to part (1) of this theorem.  So it must be that x + 1 ≤ y.  Second, suppose that x + 1 ≤ y.  Then by [int_le_trans] we deduce that x + 1 ≤ x.  However 1 : ℤ > 0, so by [int_lt_add_right] we know that x + 1 > x + 0 = x.  This is a contradiction.

Theorem.  Let a, b, c ∈ ℤ.  If c > 0 and ab = c, then a ≤ c.    [int_factor_less]

Proof.  Let a, b, c ∈ ℤ, and suppose that c > 0 and ab = c.  If a < 0 then by [int_lt_trans] we have a < c.  If a = 0 then c = 0, which is a contradiction.  Now suppose that a > 0.  If b ≤ 0 then by [int_mul_pos_nonneg] we have c ≤ 0, a contradiction.  So b > 0.  By [int_discrete_lt] b ≥ 1.  Then by [int_lt_mul_right] we have b · a ≥ 1 · a, so c ≥ a.
