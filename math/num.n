Definition.  For all a, b : ℤ, a | b iff there exists c : ℤ such that b = ac.

Theorem.  Let a, b, c : ℤ.

    a. a | 0.
    b. 1 | a.
    c. a | a.
    d. If a | b and b | c then a | c.
    e. If c ≠ 0 and a | c then |a| ≤ |c|.  [divides implies ≤]
    f. If 0 | c then c = 0.  [0 divides only 0]
    g. a | b and b | a if and only if a = b or a = −b.
    h. a | a · b.
    i. If a | b and a | c then a | (b + c).
    j. If a | b and a | c then a | (b − c).
    k. If a | 1 then a = 1 or a = −1.

Proof.

    d. Suppose that a | b and b | c.  Then there are some d, e : ℤ such that b = ad and c = be.  Then c = (ad)e = a(de).  Hence a | c.

    e. Suppose that a | c and c ≠ 0.  Then there exists some b : ℤ such that c = ab.  Hence |c| = |a| · |b|.  c ≠ 0, so b ≠ 0.  We know that |b| ≥ 0, so we have |b| > 0.  Therefore by [< iff successor ≤ on ℤ] |b| ≥ 0 + 1 = 1 : ℤ.  Hence
    
        |c| = |a| · |b|
             ≥ |a| · 1  by [≤ mul right on ℤ]
             = |a|.

    f. Suppose that 0 | c.  Then c = 0 · d for some d : ℤ, so c = 0.

    g. Suppose that a | b and b | a.  If a = 0 or b = 0 then by [0 divides only 0] a = 0 = b.  If a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0 then by [divides implies ≤] |a| ≤ |b|, also by [divides implies ≤] |b| ≤ |a|, so by [trichotomy on ℤ] |a| = |b|, so a = b or a = −b.

    Now suppose that a = b.  Then clearly a | b and b | a.  Finally, suppose that a = −b.  Then a = −(1 · b) = −1 · b.  Also b = −a = −(1 · a) = −1 · a, so a | b and b | a.

    i. Suppose that a | b and a | c.  Then there exist d, e : ℤ such that b = da and c = ea.  Then b + c = da + ea = (d + e) · a, so a | (b + c).

    j. Suppose that a | b and a | c.  Then there exist d, e : ℤ such that b = da and c = ea.  Then b − c = da − ea = (d − e) · a, so a | (b − c).

Theorem (Division).  Let a, b : ℤ.  Suppose that a > 0.  Then there exist q, r : ℤ such that b = qa + r and 0 ≤ r < a.

Proof.  Let B = { b : ℤ | b ≥ 0 and there exist q, r : ℤ such that b = qa + r and 0 ≤ r < a }.  0 = 0 · a + 0 and 0 : ℤ ≤ 0 < a, so 0 ∈ B.  Now let c ∈ B.  Then c ≥ 0, so c + 1 ≥ 0.  Also there exist q, r : ℤ such that c = qa + r and 0 ≤ r < a.  Since r < a, it follows by [< iff successor ≤ on ℤ] that r + 1 ≤ a.

Suppose that r + 1 = a.  Then

    c + 1 = qa + (r + 1) = qa + a = (q + 1) · a + 0 and 0 : ℤ ≤ 0 < a, so c + 1 ∈ B.

Now suppose that r + 1 < a.  Then

    c + 1 = qa + (r + 1) and 0 ≤ r + 1 < a, so c + 1 ∈ B.

In any case c + 1 ∈ B.  We know that B ⊆ 𝒢, and we have shown that for all c ∈ B, c + 1 ∈ B.  So by [induction on ℤ] B = 𝒢.

Either b ≥ 0 or b < 0.  Suppose that b ≥ 0.  Then b ∈ B, so there exist q, r : ℤ such that b = qa + r and 0 ≤ r < a.

Now suppose that b < 0.  Then −b > 0, so −b ∈ B, so there exist q, r : ℤ such that −b = qa + r and 0 ≤ r < a.

Either r = 0 or r > 0.  Suppose that r = 0.  Then −b = qa, so b = (−q) · a + 0, so there exist s, t : ℤ such that b = sa + t and 0 ≤ t < a.

Now suppose that r > 0.  Then b = −(qa + r) = (−q) · a + (−r) = (−q) · a + (a − r) − a = (−q − 1) · a + (a − r).  Observe that a − r < a since r > 0.  Also 0 < a − r since r < a.  Therefore 0 ≤ a − r < a.  So there exist s, t : ℤ such that b = sa + t and 0 ≤ t < a.

Theorem (Uniqueness of Division).  Let a, b : ℤ.  Suppose that a > 0.  Suppose that there exist q, r, q', r' : ℤ such that b = q · a + r = q' · a + r', and 0 ≤ r < a and 0 ≤ r' < a.  Then q = q' and r = r'.

Proof.  Notice that r' = b − q' · a and r = b − q · a, so r' − r = q · a − q' · a = (q − q') · a.

Suppose that r' = r.  Then r' − r = 0.  Hence (q − q') · a = 0.  But a ≠ 0.  Hence q − q' = 0.  Therefore q = q'.

Now suppose that r ≠ r'.  Then r' − r ≠ 0, hence q − q' ≠ 0.  Therefore |q − q'| ≥ 1, so |(q - q') · a| = |q - q'| · |a| ≥ 1 · |a| = a.  Thus |r' − r| ≥ a.

We know that r' < a and −r ≤ 0, so r' − r < a + 0 = a.  Likewise, r < a and −r' ≤ 0, so r − r' < a + 0 = a.

However either |r' − r| = r − r' or |r' − r| = r' − r.  So |r' − r| < a.  This is a contradiction.  So r' = r and q' = q.
