# Natural numbers: definition

Axiom.  There exists a type ℕ (the natural numbers) with an element 0 ∈ ℕ and a function s : ℕ → ℕ such that

  a. There is no n ∈ ℕ such that s(n) = 0.  [nat_succ_zero]
  b. For all n, m ∈ ℕ, if s(n) = s(m) then n = m.  [nat_succ_injective]
  c. Let P : ℕ → 𝔹.  If 0 ∈ P, and k ∈ P implies s(k) ∈ P for all k ∈ ℕ, then P = ℕ.  [nat_induction]

Definition.  Let 1 : ℕ = s(0).  Let 2 : ℕ = s(1).

Lemma (nat_prec).  Let a ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that a ≠ 0.  Then there is some b ∈ ℕ such that a = s(b).

# Natural numbers: addition

  a. n + 0 = n.
  b. n + s(m) = s(n + m).

Theorem.  Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.

  1. If a + c = b + c, then a = b.      [nat_add_cancel]
  2. (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).
  3. 0 + a = a = a + 0.
  4. 1 + a = s(a) = a + 1.
  5. s(a) + b = s(a + b).
  6. a + b = b + a.
  7. a ≠ s(a). 
  8. s(a) + s(b) ≠ 1.       [nat_no_sum_one]
  9. a + s(b) ≠ a.
  10. If a + b = 0, then a = 0 and b = 0.

# Natural numbers: multiplication

Axiom.  There is a binary operation · : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ such that for all n, m ∈ ℕ,

  a. n · 0 = 0.
  b. n · s(m) = (n · m) + n.

Theorem.  Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.

  1. a · 0 = 0 = 0 · a.
  2. a · 1 = a = 1 · a.  [nat_mul_ident]
  3. c(a + b) = ca + cb.
  4. (ab)c = a(bc). 
  5. s(a) · b = ab + b.  [nat_succ_mul]
  6. ab = ba.
  7. (a + b)c = ac + bc.

Theorem.  Let a, b ∈ ℕ.

  1. ab = 0 if and only if a = 0 or b = 0.      [nat_prod_0]
  2. ab = 1 if and only if a = 1 and b = 1.   [nat_prod_1]

Proof.

  2. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  If a = 1 and b = 1, then ab = 1.
  
  Now suppose that ab = 1.  If a = 0 then ab = 0, a contradiction.  Similarly, if b = 0 then ab = 0, a contradiction.  So a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0.  Then by :nat_prec there exist c, d ∈ ℕ such that a = s(c) and b = s(d).

  Suppose that c ≠ 0.  Then there exists e ∈ ℕ such that c = s(e), so a = s(s(e)).  Then

    s(0) = 1 = s(s(e)) · s(d)
                   = s(e) · s(d) + s(d)
                   = e · s(d) + s(d) + s(d)
                   = s(e · s(d) + d) + s(d)
                   = s(e · s(d) + d + s(d))
                   = s(s(e · s(d) + d + d)).

  By :nat_succ_injective, 0 = s(e · s(d) + d + d).  This is a contradiction to :nat_succ_zero.  So it must be that c = 0.  Therefore a = s(0) = 1.  Then 1 · b = 1.  By :nat_mul_ident 1 · b = b, so we have b = 1.  And so a = b = 1.

# Right cancellation of multiplication

Theorem.  Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.  If c ≠ 0 and ac = bc then a = b.

Proof. Let

        G = { x ∈ ℕ | for all y, z ∈ ℕ, if z ≠ 0 and xz = yz then x = y }.

  Let b, c ∈ ℕ with c ≠ 0 and 0 · c = bc. Then bc = 0.  Since c ≠ 0, we must have b = 0 by :nat_prod_0.  So 0 = b, and hence 0 ∈ G.

  Now let a ∈ ℕ, and suppose that a ∈ G.  Let b, c ∈ ℕ, and suppose that c ≠ 0 and s(a) · c = bc.  Then by :nat_succ_mul we deduce that ca + c = bc.  If b = 0, then either s(a) = 0 or c = 0, which is a contradiction.  Hence b ≠ 0.  By :nat_prec there is some p ∈ ℕ such that b = s(p).  Therefore ca + c = s(p) · c, and we see that ca + c = cp + c.  It follows by :nat_add_cancel that ca = cp, so ac = pc.  By hypothesis it follows that a = p.  Therefore s(a) = s(p) = b.  Hence s(a) ∈ G, and we deduce that G = ℕ.

# Natural numbers: inequalities

Definition.  For all a, b ∈ ℕ, a ≤ b iff there is some c ∈ ℕ such that a + c = b.  a < b iff a ≤ b and a ≠ b.

Definition.  For all a, b ∈ ℕ, we write a ≥ b iff b ≤ a.  We write a > b iff b < a.

Theorem.  Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.

  1. a ≤ a, and a ≮ a, and a < s(a).   [nat_lt]
  2. 0 ≤ a.  [nat_ge_0]
  3. If a ≤ b and b ≤ c, then a ≤ c.   [nat_le_trans]
  4. If a ≤ b and b < c, then a < c.
  5. If a < b and b ≤ c, then a < c.
  6. If a < b and b < c, then a < c.   [nat_lt_trans]

Proof.

  3. Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that a ≤ b and b ≤ c.  Then there exist d, e ∈ ℕ such that a + d = b and b + e = c.  Then a + (d + e) = (a + d) + e = b + e = c, so a ≤ c.

  4. Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that a ≤ b and b < c.  Then b ≤ c, so a ≤ c by part (3) of this theorem.  There exist d, e ∈ ℕ such that a + d = b and b + e = c.  So a + (d + e) = (a + d) + e = b + e = c.  If e = 0 then b = c, which is a contradiction.  So e ≠ 0, and so there exists f ∈ ℕ such that e = s(f).  Then a + (d + s(f)) = c, so a + s(d + f) = c.  If a = c then a + s(d + f) = a, which is a contradiction.  So a ≠ c.  It follows that a < c.

  5. Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that a < b and b ≤ c.  Then a ≤ b, so a ≤ c by part (3) of this theorem.  There exist d, e ∈ ℕ such that a + d = b and b + e = c.  So a + (d + e) = (a + d) + e = b + e = c.  If d = 0 then a = b, which is a contradiction.  So d ≠ 0, and so there exists f ∈ ℕ such that d = s(f).  Then a + (s(f) + e) = c, so a + s(f + e) = c.  If a = c then a + s(f + e) = a, which is a contradiction.  So a ≠ c.  It follows that a < c.

Theorem.  Let a, b ∈ ℕ.

  1. Precisely one of a < b or a = b or a > b holds.        [nat_trichotomy]
  2. a ≤ b if and only if a ≯ b.
  3. a ≤ b or b ≤ a.
  4. If a ≤ b and b ≤ a, then a = b.         [nat_le_antisymm]

Proof.

  1. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that a < b and a = b.  It then follows that a < a, which is a contradiction to :nat_lt.  Now suppose that a = b and a > b.  It follows that a > a, which is similarly a contradiction.  Now suppose that a < b and b < a.  By :nat_lt_trans we deduce that a < a, again a contradiction.

  Now let

      G = { x ∈ ℕ | for all y ∈ ℕ, x < y or x = y or x > y }.

  We will show that x ∈ G for all x ∈ ℕ.  We start by showing that 0 ∈ G.  Let y ∈ ℕ.  By :nat_ge_0 we know that 0 ≤ y.  It follows that y = 0 or y > 0.  Hence 0 ∈ G.

  Now let x ∈ ℕ, and suppose that x ∈ G.  We will show that s(x) ∈ G.  Let y ∈ ℕ.  By hypothesis we know that x < y or x = y or x > y.
  
  First suppose that x < y.  Then there is some p ∈ ℕ such that x + p = y.  If p = 0, then x = y, so s(x) > y by :nat_lt.  If p ≠ 0, then by :nat_prec there is some r ∈ ℕ such that p = s(r), which implies that x + s(r) = y, which implies s(x) + r = y, so s(x) ≤ y, so either s(x) < y or s(x) = y.

  Next suppose that x = y.  Then by :nat_lt it follows that s(x) > x = y.  Finally, suppose that x > y.  We know that s(x) > x, and by :nat_lt_trans it follows that s(x) > y.

  Putting the cases together, we see that s(x) < y or s(x) = y or s(x) > y always holds.  Hence s(x) ∈ G, and we conclude that G = ℕ.

  3. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  We know that a < b or a = b or a > b.  If a < b, then a ≤ b.  If a = b, then a ≤ b.  If a > b, then b ≤ a.  In any case a ≤ b or b ≤ a.

# More identities involving inequalities

Theorem.  Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.

  1. a < b if and only if s(a) < s(b).
  2. If a < b then a + c < b + c.           [nat_lt_add_right]
  3. If a + c < b + c then a < b.           [nat_lt_add_cancel]
  4. If c ≠ 0 and a < b, then ac < bc.
  5. If ac < bc, then a < b.
  
Proof.

  1. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that a < b.  Then there is some c ∈ ℕ such that a + c = b.  So a + 1 + c = b + 1.  Then s(a) + c = s(b), so s(a) < s(b).

  Now suppose that s(a) < s(b).  Then there is some c ∈ ℕ such that s(a) + c = s(b).  So a + 1 + c = b + 1.  Then a + c = b, so a < b.

  2. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that a < b.  Let

      G = { c ∈ ℕ | a + c < b + c }.

  Clearly 0 ∈ G.  Let c ∈ ℕ, and suppose that c ∈ G.  Then a + c < b + c, so s(a + c) < s(b + c) by part (1) of this theorem.  Then a + s(c) < b + s(c), so s(c) ∈ G.  Hence G = ℕ.

  3. Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ, and suppose that a + c < b + c.  If a = b then b + c < b + c, a contradiction. If b < a then b + c < a + c by part (2) of this theorem, so b + c < a + c < b + c, also a contradiction.  By :nat_trichotomy, the only alternative is a < b.

  4. Let a, b ∈ ℕ, and suppose that a < b.  Let

    G = { c ∈ ℕ | if c ≠ 0, then ac < bc }.

  Clearly 0 ∈ G.  Let c ∈ ℕ, and suppose that c ∈ G.  We will show that s(c) ∈ G.  We know that a · 1 < b · 1.  Suppose that c = 0. Then a · s(c) < b · s(c), so s(c) ∈ G.  Conversely, suppose that c ≠ 0.  By hypothesis we know that ac < bc.  Then by :nat_lt_add_right we have ac + a < bc + a, and also bc + a < bc + b.  So ac + a < bc + b, so a · s(c) < b · s(c), so s(c) ∈ G.  And so G = ℕ.

  5. Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ, and suppose that ac < bc.  If c = 0 then 0 < 0, which is a contradiction.  So c ≠ 0.  If a = b then bc < bc, a contradiction.  If b < a then bc < ac by part (4) of this theorem, so bc < ac < bc, also a contradiction.  By :nat_trichotomy, the only alternative is a < b.

Theorem.  Let a, b ∈ ℕ.

  1. It cannot be that b < a < b + 1.   [nat_discrete]
  2. a ≤ b if and only if a < b + 1.       [nat_discrete_le]
  3. a < b if and only if a + 1 ≤ b.

Proof.

  1. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that b < a < b + 1.  Then there are g, h ∈ ℕ such that b + g = a and a + h = b + 1.  Then (b + g) + h = b + 1, so (g + h) + b = 1 + b, so g + h = 1.  If g = 0 then b = a, which is a contradiction.  So there is some j ∈ ℕ such that g = s(j).  Similarly, if h = 0 then a = b + 1, which is a contradiction.  So there is some k ∈ ℕ such that h = s(k).  Therefore s(j) + s(k) = 1.  This is a contradiction to :nat_no_sum_one.

  2. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  First suppose that a ≤ b.  Suppose further that a ≥ b + 1.  Then by :nat_le_trans we deduce that b + 1 ≤ b, which is a contradiction to :nat_lt.  So it must be that a < b + 1.  Second, suppose that a < b + 1.  Suppose further that a > b.  It follows that b < a < b + 1, which is a contradiction to part (1) of this theorem.  So it must be that a ≤ b.

  3. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  First suppose that a < b.  Suppose further that a + 1 > b.  It follows that a < b < a + 1, which is a contradiction to part (1) of this theorem.  So it must be that a + 1 ≤ b. Second, suppose that a + 1 ≤ b.  Suppose further that a ≥ b.  Then by :nat_le_trans we deduce that a + 1 ≤ a, which is a contradiction to :nat_lt.  So it must be that a < b.

Lemma (nat_add_prod).  Let a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ.  If a < b and c < d, then bc + ad < ac + bd.

Proof.

  Let a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ, and suppose that a < b and c < d.  Then there exist g, h ∈ ℕ with g ≠ 0 and h ≠ 0 such that b = a + g and d = c + h.  Then

    ac + bd = ac + (a + g)(c + h)
                = ac + a(c + h) + g(c + h)
                = ac + ac + ah + g(c + h)
                = ac + ac + ah + gc + gh
                = ac + gc + ac + ah + gh
                = (a + g)c + a(c + h) + gh
                = (bc + ad) + gh.

   We must have gh ≠ 0, and so bc + ad < ac + bd.

# Well-ordering principle on naturals

Definition.  For all S : ℕ → 𝔹, S is empty iff there is no n : ℕ such that n ∈ S.  S is nonempty iff S is not empty.

Definition.  For all A : ℕ → 𝔹 and a : ℕ, a is a least element of A iff a ∈ A and for all x : ℕ, if x ∈ A then a ≤ x.

Theorem (nat_well_ordered). Let G : ℕ → 𝔹.  Suppose that G is nonempty.  Then there exists some m : ℕ such that m is a least element of G.

Proof.  Let G : ℕ → 𝔹, and suppose that G is nonempty.  Suppose that there is no m : ℕ such that m ∈ G and for all g ∈ ℕ, if g ∈ G then m ≤ g.  Let

    H = { a ∈ ℕ | for all n ∈ ℕ, if n ≤ a then n ∉ G }.

We will show that H = ℕ.

Suppose that 0 ∉ H.  Then there is some q ∈ ℕ such that q ≤ 0 and q ∈ G.  By :nat_le_antisymm we see that q = 0.  Hence 0 ∈ G.  It then follows from :nat_ge_0 that for all g ∈ ℕ, if g ∈ G then 0 ≤ g, which is a contradiction.  Therefore 0 ∈ H.

Now let a : ℕ, and suppose that a ∈ H.  Suppose further that a + 1 ∉ H.  Then there is some p ∈ ℕ such that p ≤ a + 1 and p ∈ G.  If p ≤ a, then we have p ∉ G, which is a contradiction.  Hence by :nat_trichotomy we deduce that a < p.  Therefore a < p ≤ a + 1, and it follows from :nat_discrete that p = a + 1.  Hence a + 1 ∈ G.  Now let x : ℕ, and suppose that x ∈ G.  Suppose that x < a + 1.  Then x ≤ a by :nat_discrete_le.  Because a ∈ H, it follows that x ∉ G, which is a contradiction.  Hence a + 1 ≤ x by :nat_trichotomy.  So for all g : ℕ, if g ∈ G then a + 1 ≤ g.  This is a contradiction.  It follows that a + 1 ∈ H, and hence H = ℕ.

Let b : ℕ.  We know that b ∈ H. Since b ≤ b, we have b ∉ G.  And so G is empty, which is a contradiction.
