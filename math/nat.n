# Natural numbers: definition

Axiom.  There exists a type ℕ (the natural numbers) with an element 0 ∈ ℕ and a function s : ℕ → ℕ such that

  a. There is no n ∈ ℕ such that s(n) = 0.  [succ 0]
  b. For all n, m ∈ ℕ, if s(n) = s(m) then n = m.  [succ injective]
  c. Let P : ℕ → 𝔹.  If 0 ∈ P, and k ∈ P implies s(k) ∈ P for all k ∈ ℕ, then P = ℕ.  [induction]

Theorem.  Let x ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that x ≠ 0.  Then there is some y ∈ ℕ such that x = s(y).

Theorem.  For all x ∈ ℕ, s(x) ≠ x.

# Addition

Axiom.  There is a binary operation + : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ such that for all x, y ∈ ℕ,

  a. x + 0 = x.
  b. x + s(y) = s(x + y).

Lemma.  For all x, y ∈ ℕ, x + (y + 0) = (x + y) + 0.

Theorem (associativity of addition).  For all x, y, z ∈ ℕ,

    x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z.

Lemma.

    a. For all x ∈ ℕ, 0 + x = x.
    b. For all x, y ∈ ℕ, s(x) + y = s(x + y).

Theorem (commutativity of addition).  For all x, y : ℕ,

    x + y = y + x.

Theorem (cancellation law for addition).  For all x, y, z ∈ ℕ,

    x + z = y + z implies x = y.

# Ordering

Definition.  For all a, b ∈ ℕ, a ≤ b iff there is some c ∈ ℕ such that a + c = b.  a < b iff a ≤ b and a ≠ b.

Definition.  For all a, b ∈ ℕ, we write a ≥ b iff b ≤ a.  We write a > b iff b < a.
