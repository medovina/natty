# Cardinality

Definition.  For all S : Set(σ) and T : Set(τ), S ~ T if there exists some f : σ → τ such that f is a bijection from S to T.

Theorem.  Let A : Set(σ).  Then A ≁ 𝒫(A).

Proof.  Suppose that A ~ 𝒫(A).  Then there is some f : σ → Set(σ) such that f is a bijection from A to 𝒫(A).  Let D = {a ∈ A | a ∉ f(a) }. Observe that D ⊆ A, and so D ∈ 𝒫(A).  Because f is a surjection from A to 𝒫(A), there is some d : σ such that d ∈ A and f(d) = D.  Suppose that d ∈ D.  Then by the definition of D we see that d ∉ f(d), so d ∉ D, which is a contradiction.  Now suppose that d ∉ D.  Then d ∈ f(d), so d ∈ D, which is a contradiction.  In any case we have a contradiction, and so A ≁ 𝒫(A).

# Finite and infinite sets

Definition.  For all S : Set(σ), S is finite if there exists n : ℤ such that { k ∈ ℤ | 1 ≤ k ≤ n } ~ S.   S is infinite iff S is not finite.

Corollary (finite set).  For all S : Set(σ), if S is finite then there exists n : ℤ and f : ℤ → σ such that S = { x : σ | x = f(i) for some i : ℤ with 1 ≤ i ≤ n }.

Proof.  Let S : Set(σ), and suppose that S is finite.  Then there is some n : ℤ such that { i ∈ ℤ | 1 ≤ i ≤ n } ~ S.  And there is some f : ℤ → σ such that f is a bijection from { i ∈ ℤ | 1 ≤ i ≤ n } to S. 

Let x ∈ S.  Because f is a surjection from { i ∈ ℤ | 1 ≤ i ≤ n } to S, there exists some i : ℤ with 1 ≤ i ≤ n such that x = f(i).

Let x : σ, and suppose there is some i : ℤ with 1 ≤ i ≤ n such that x = f(i).  Because f is a mapping from { i ∈ ℤ | 1 ≤ i ≤ n } to S, f(i) ∈ S, so x ∈ S.

Therefore S = { x : σ | x = f(i) for some i : ℤ with 1 ≤ i ≤ n }.
