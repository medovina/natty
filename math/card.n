# Cardinality

Definition.  For all S : Set(σ) and T : Set(τ), S ~ T if there exists some f : σ → τ such that f is a bijection from S to T.

# Cantor's Theorem, Wiedijk #63

Theorem.  Let A : Set(σ).  Then A ≁ 𝒫(A).

Proof.  Suppose that A ~ 𝒫(A).  Then there is some f : σ → Set(σ) such that f is a bijection from A to 𝒫(A).  Let D = {a ∈ A | a ∉ f(a) }. Observe that D ⊆ A, and so D ∈ 𝒫(A).  Because f is a surjection from A to 𝒫(A), there is some d : σ such that d ∈ A and f(d) = D.  Suppose that d ∈ D.  Then by the definition of D we see that d ∉ f(d), so d ∉ D, which is a contradiction.  Now suppose that d ∉ D.  Then d ∈ f(d), so d ∈ D, which is a contradiction.  In any case we have a contradiction, and so A ≁ 𝒫(A).

# Finite and infinite sets

Definition.  For all S : Set(σ), S is finite if there exists n : ℕ such that S ~ { k ∈ ℕ | k < n }.   S is infinite iff S is not finite.
