Axiom 3.  There is a binary operation · : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ such that for all n, m ∈ ℕ,

  a. n · 0 = 0.
  b. n · s(m) = (n · m) + n.

Theorem 3.  Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.

  1. a · 0 = 0 = 0 · a.
  2. a · 1 = a = 1 · a.
  3. c(a + b) = ca + cb.
  4. (ab)c = a(bc). 
  5. s(a) · b = ab + b.
  6. ab = ba.
  7. (a + b)c = ac + bc.

Theorem 4.  Let a, b ∈ ℕ.

  1. ab = 0 if and only if a = 0 or b = 0.
  2. ab = 1 if and only if a = 1 and b = 1.

Proof.

  2. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  If a = 1 and b = 1, then ab = 1.
  
  Now suppose that ab = 1.  If a = 0 then ab = 0, a contradiction.  Similarly, if b = 0 then ab = 0, a contradiction.  So a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0.  Then by Lemma 1 there exist c, d ∈ ℕ such that a = s(c) and b = s(d).

  Suppose that c ≠ 0.  Then there exists e ∈ ℕ such that c = s(e), so a = s(s(e)).  Then

    s(0) = 1 = s(s(e)) · s(d)
                   = s(e) · s(d) + s(d)
                   = e · s(d) + s(d) + s(d)
                   = s(e · s(d) + d) + s(d)
                   = s(e · s(d) + d + s(d))
                   = s(s(e · s(d) + d + d)).

  By Axiom 1(b), 0 = s(e · s(d) + d + d).  This is a contradiction to Axiom 1(a).  So it must be that c = 0.  Therefore a = s(0) = 1.  Then 1 · b = 1.  By Theorem 3.2 1 · b = b, so we have b = 1.  And so a = b = 1.

Theorem 5.  Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.  If c ≠ 0 and ac = bc then a = b.

Proof. Let

        G = { x ∈ ℕ | for all y, z ∈ ℕ, if z ≠ 0 and xz = yz then x = y }.

  Let b, c ∈ ℕ with c ≠ 0 and 0 · c = bc. Then bc = 0.  Since c ≠ 0, we must have b = 0 by Theorem 4.1.  So 0 = b, and hence 0 ∈ G.

  Now let a ∈ ℕ, and suppose that a ∈ G.  Let b, c ∈ ℕ, and suppose that c ≠ 0 and s(a) · c = bc.  Then by Theorem 3.5 we deduce that ca + c = bc.  If b = 0, then either s(a) = 0 or c = 0, which is a contradiction.  Hence b ≠ 0.  By Lemma 1 there is some p ∈ ℕ such that b = s(p).  Therefore ca + c = s(p) · c, and we see that ca + c = cp + c.  It follows by Theorem 2.1 that ca = cp, so ac = pc.  By hypothesis it follows that a = p.  Therefore s(a) = s(p) = b.  Hence s(a) ∈ G, and we deduce that G = ℕ.

# Natural numbers: inequalities

Definition.  For all a, b ∈ ℕ, a ≤ b iff there is some c ∈ ℕ such that a + c = b.  a < b iff a ≤ b and a ≠ b.

Definition.  For all a, b ∈ ℕ, we write a ≥ b iff b ≤ a.  We write a > b iff b < a.

Theorem 6.  Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.

  1. a ≤ a, and a ≮ a, and a < s(a).
  2. 0 ≤ a.
  3. If a ≤ b and b ≤ c, then a ≤ c.
  4. If a ≤ b and b < c, then a < c.
  5. If a < b and b ≤ c, then a < c.
  6. If a < b and b < c, then a < c.

Proof.

  3. Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that a ≤ b and b ≤ c.  Then there exist d, e ∈ ℕ such that a + d = b and b + e = c.  Then a + (d + e) = (a + d) + e = b + e = c, so a ≤ c.

  4. Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that a ≤ b and b < c.  Then b ≤ c, so a ≤ c by part (3) of this theorem.  There exist d, e ∈ ℕ such that a + d = b and b + e = c.  So a + (d + e) = (a + d) + e = b + e = c.  If e = 0 then b = c, which is a contradiction.  So e ≠ 0, and so there exists f ∈ ℕ such that e = s(f).  Then a + (d + s(f)) = c, so a + s(d + f) = c.  If a = c then a + s(d + f) = a, which is a contradiction.  So a ≠ c.  It follows that a < c.

  5. Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that a < b and b ≤ c.  Then a ≤ b, so a ≤ c by part (3) of this theorem.  There exist d, e ∈ ℕ such that a + d = b and b + e = c.  So a + (d + e) = (a + d) + e = b + e = c.  If d = 0 then a = b, which is a contradiction.  So d ≠ 0, and so there exists f ∈ ℕ such that d = s(f).  Then a + (s(f) + e) = c, so a + s(f + e) = c.  If a = c then a + s(f + e) = a, which is a contradiction.  So a ≠ c.  It follows that a < c.

Theorem 7.  Let a, b ∈ ℕ.

  1. Precisely one of a < b or a = b or a > b holds.
  2. a ≤ b if and only if a ≯ b.
  3. a ≤ b or b ≤ a.
  4. If a ≤ b and b ≤ a, then a = b.

Proof.

  1. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that a < b and a = b.  It then follows that a < a, which is a contradiction to Theorem 6.1.  Now suppose that a = b and a > b.  It follows that a > a, which is similarly a contradiction.  Now suppose that a < b and b < a.  By Theorem 6.6 we deduce that a < a, again a contradiction.

  Now let

      G = { x ∈ ℕ | for all y ∈ ℕ, x < y or x = y or x > y }.

  We will show that x ∈ G for all x ∈ ℕ.  We start by showing that 0 ∈ G.  Let y ∈ ℕ.  By Theorem 6.2 we know that 0 ≤ y.  It follows that y = 0 or y > 0.  Hence 0 ∈ G.

  Now let x ∈ ℕ, and suppose that x ∈ G.  We will show that s(x) ∈ G.  Let y ∈ ℕ.  By hypothesis we know that x < y or x = y or x > y.
  
  First suppose that x < y.  Then there is some p ∈ ℕ such that x + p = y.  If p = 0, then x = y, so s(x) > y by Theorem 6.1.  If p ≠ 0, then by Lemma 1 there is some r ∈ ℕ such that p = s(r), which implies that x + s(r) = y, which implies s(x) + r = y, so s(x) ≤ y, so either s(x) < y or s(x) = y.

  Next suppose that x = y.  Then by Theorem 6.1 it follows that s(x) > x = y.  Finally, suppose that x > y.  We know that s(x) > x, and by Theorem 6.6 it follows that s(x) > y.

  Putting the cases together, we see that s(x) < y or s(x) = y or s(x) > y always holds.  Hence s(x) ∈ G, and we conclude that G = ℕ.

  3. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  We know that a < b or a = b or a > b.  If a < b, then a ≤ b.  If a = b, then a ≤ b.  If a > b, then b ≤ a.  In any case a ≤ b or b ≤ a.

Theorem 8.  Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.

  1. a < b if and only if s(a) < s(b).
  2. If a < b then a + c < b + c.
  3. If a + c < b + c then a < b.
  4. If c ≠ 0 and a < b, then ac < bc.
  5. If ac < bc, then a < b.
  
Proof.

  1. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that a < b.  Then there is some c ∈ ℕ such that a + c = b.  So a + 1 + c = b + 1.  Then s(a) + c = s(b), so s(a) < s(b).

  Now suppose that s(a) < s(b).  Then there is some c ∈ ℕ such that s(a) + c = s(b).  So a + 1 + c = b + 1.  Then a + c = b, so a < b.

  2. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that a < b.  Let

      G = { c ∈ ℕ | a + c < b + c }.

  Clearly 0 ∈ G.  Let c ∈ ℕ, and suppose that c ∈ G.  Then a + c < b + c, so s(a + c) < s(b + c) by part (1) of this theorem.  Then a + s(c) < b + s(c), so s(c) ∈ G.  Hence G = ℕ.

  3. Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ, and suppose that a + c < b + c.  If a = b then b + c < b + c, a contradiction. If b < a then b + c < a + c by part (2) of this theorem, so b + c < a + c < b + c, also a contradiction.  By Theorem 7.1, the only alternative is a < b.

  4. Let a, b ∈ ℕ, and suppose that a < b.  Let

    G = { c ∈ ℕ | if c ≠ 0, then ac < bc }.

  Clearly 0 ∈ G.  Let c ∈ ℕ, and suppose that c ∈ G.  We will show that s(c) ∈ G.  We know that a · 1 < b · 1.  Suppose that c = 0. Then a · s(c) < b · s(c), so s(c) ∈ G.  Conversely, suppose that c ≠ 0.  By hypothesis we know that ac < bc.  Then by Theorem 8.2 we have ac + a < bc + a, and also bc + a < bc + b.  So ac + a < bc + b, so a · s(c) < b · s(c), so s(c) ∈ G.  And so G = ℕ.

  5. Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ, and suppose that ac < bc.  If c = 0 then 0 < 0, which is a contradiction.  So c ≠ 0.  If a = b then bc < bc, a contradiction.  If b < a then bc < ac by part (4) of this theorem, so bc < ac < bc, also a contradiction.  By Theorem 7.1, the only alternative is a < b.

Theorem 9.  Let a, b ∈ ℕ.

  1. It cannot be that b < a < b + 1.
  2. a ≤ b if and only if a < b + 1.
  3. a < b if and only if a + 1 ≤ b.

Proof.

  1. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that b < a < b + 1.  Then there are g, h ∈ ℕ such that b + g = a and a + h = b + 1.  Then (b + g) + h = b + 1, so (g + h) + b = 1 + b, so g + h = 1.  If g = 0 then b = a, which is a contradiction.  So there is some j ∈ ℕ such that g = s(j).  Similarly, if h = 0 then a = b + 1, which is a contradiction.  So there is some k ∈ ℕ such that h = s(k).  Therefore s(j) + s(k) = 1.  This is a contradiction to Theorem 2.8.

  2. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  First suppose that a ≤ b.  Suppose further that a ≥ b + 1.  Then by Theorem 6.3 we deduce that b + 1 ≤ b, which is a contradiction to Theorem 6.1.  So it must be that a < b + 1.  Second, suppose that a < b + 1.  Suppose further that a > b.  It follows that b < a < b + 1, which is a contradiction to part (1) of this theorem.  So it must be that a ≤ b.

  3. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  First suppose that a < b.  Suppose further that a + 1 > b.  It follows that a < b < a + 1, which is a contradiction to part (1) of this theorem.  So it must be that a + 1 ≤ b. Second, suppose that a + 1 ≤ b.  Suppose further that a ≥ b.  Then by Theorem 6.3 we deduce that a + 1 ≤ a, which is a contradiction to Theorem 6.1.  So it must be that a < b.

Lemma 10.  Let a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ.  If a < b and c < d, then bc + ad < ac + bd.

Proof.

  Let a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ, and suppose that a < b and c < d.  Then there exist g, h ∈ ℕ with g ≠ 0 and h ≠ 0 such that b = a + g and d = c + h.  Then

    ac + bd = ac + (a + g)(c + h)
                = ac + a(c + h) + g(c + h)
                = ac + ac + ah + g(c + h)
                = ac + ac + ah + gc + gh
                = ac + gc + ac + ah + gh
                = (a + g)c + a(c + h) + gh
                = (bc + ad) + gh.

   We must have gh ≠ 0, and so bc + ad < ac + bd.

Lemma 11. Let G : ℕ → 𝔹.  Suppose that there exists some b : ℕ such that b ∈ G.  Then there exists some m : ℕ such that m ∈ G and for all g ∈ ℕ, if g ∈ G then m ≤ g.

Proof.  Let G : ℕ → 𝔹, and suppose that there exists some b : ℕ such that b ∈ G.  Suppose that there is no m : ℕ such that m ∈ G and for all g ∈ ℕ, if g ∈ G then m ≤ g.  Let

    H = { a ∈ ℕ | for all n ∈ ℕ, if n ≤ a then n ∉ G }.

We will show that H = ℕ.

Suppose that 0 ∉ H.  Then there is some q ∈ ℕ such that q ≤ 0 and q ∈ G.  By Theorem 7.4 we see that q = 0.  Hence 0 ∈ G.  It then follows from Theorem 6.2 that for all g ∈ ℕ, if g ∈ G then 0 ≤ g, which is a contradiction.  Therefore 0 ∈ H.

Now let a : ℕ, and suppose that a ∈ H.  Suppose further that a + 1 ∉ H.  Then there is some p ∈ ℕ such that p ≤ a + 1 and p ∈ G.  If p ≤ a, then we have p ∉ G, which is a contradiction.  Hence by Theorem 7.1 we deduce that a < p.  Therefore a < p ≤ a + 1, and it follows from Theorem 9.1 that p = a + 1.  Hence a + 1 ∈ G.  Now let x : ℕ, and suppose that x ∈ G.  Suppose that x < a + 1.  Then x ≤ a by Theorem 9.2.  Because a ∈ H, it follows that x ∉ G, which is a contradiction.  Hence a + 1 ≤ x by Theorem 7.1.  So for all g : ℕ, if g ∈ G then a + 1 ≤ g.  This is a contradiction.  It follows that a + 1 ∈ H, and hence H = ℕ.

There is some b : ℕ such that b ∈ G.  Now we have b ∈ H. Since b ≤ b, we have b ∉ G, a contradiction.

Proof.

  1. Let x, y, z ∈ ℤ, and suppose that x + z = y + z.  Then (x + z) + (−z) = (y + z) + (−z), so x + (z + −z) = y + (z + −z), so x + 0 = y + 0, so x = y.

  Let i, j ∈ ℤ.  Suppose that ij = 0 and that i ≠ 0.  We will deduce that j = 0.  There are some a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ such that i = z(a, b) and j = z(c, d).  Then a ≠ b by Lemma 12.  By Axiom 7 we see that 0 = ij = z(a, b) · z(c, d) = z(ac + bd, ad + bc).  Then ac + bd = ad + bc by Lemma 12.  By Theorem 7.1 we know that either a < b or a > b.
  
  First, suppose that a < b.  Then there is some g ∈ ℕ such that a + g = b.  Hence ac + (a + g)d = ad + (a + g)c.  So ac + ad + gd = ad + ac + gc, so gd = gc.  Since a ≠ b, we must have g ≠ 0, and we deduce that d = c.

  Next, suppose that a > b.  Then there is some g ∈ ℕ such that b + g = a.  Hence (b + g)c + bd = (b + g)d + bc.  So bc + gc + bd = bd + gd + bc, so gc = gd.  Since a ≠ b, we must have g ≠ 0, and we deduce that c = d.  

  In either case c = d.  Then j = 0 by Lemma 8.

Theorem 18.  Let i, j, k ∈ ℤ.

  1. If k ≠ 0 and ik = jk, then i = j.
  2. (−i)j = −(ij).
  3. i(−j) = −(ij).

Proof.

  1. Let i, j, k ∈ ℤ, and suppose that k ≠ 0 and ik = jk.  Then ik + (−j)k = jk + (−j)k, so (i + −j)k = (j + −j)k = 0 · k = 0.  By Theorem 17 we have i + −j = 0.  Then i + −j + j = 0 + j, so i = j.

  2. Let i, j, k ∈ ℤ.  Then
  
    i(−j) = i(−j) + (ij + −(ij))
          = (i(−j) + ij) + −(ij)
          = i(−j + j) + −(ij)
          = i · 0 + −(ij)
          = −(ij).

# Integers: inequalities

Axiom 8.  There is a relation < : ℤ → ℤ → 𝔹 such that for all a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ,

    z(a, b) < z(c, d) if and only if a + d < b + c.

Definition.  For all i, j ∈ ℤ, i ≤ j iff i < j or i = j.

Definition.  For all i, j ∈ ℤ, we write i > j iff j < i.  We write i ≥ j iff j ≤ i.

Theorem 19.  Let i, j, k ∈ ℤ.

  1. Precisely one of i < j or i = j or i > j holds.
  2. If i < j and j < k, then i < k.
  3. If i < j then i + k < j + k.
  4. If i < j and k > 0, then ik < jk.

Proof.

  1. Let i, j ∈ ℤ.  Then there are some a, b, c, d ∈ ℕ such that i = z(a, b) and j = z(c, d).  By Theorem 7.1 we know that exactly one of a + d < b + c or a + d = b + c or a + d > b + c holds.  The result follows using Axiom 8.

  2. Let i, j, k ∈ ℤ, and suppose that i < j and j < k.  There are some a, b, c, d, e, f ∈ ℕ such that i = z(a, b) and j = z(c, d) and k = z(e, f).  Then z(a, b) < z(c, d) and z(c, d) < z(e, f), so a + d < b + c and c + f < d + e.  It follows that a + d + f < b + c + f and b + c + f < b + d + e, so a + d + f < b + d + e.  Then a + f < b + e by Theorem 8.3, so i < k.

  3. Let i, j, k ∈ ℤ, and suppose that i < j.  There are some a, b, c, d, e, f ∈ ℕ such that i = z(a, b) and j = z(c, d) and k = z(e, f).  Then z(a, b) < z(c, d), and therefore a + d < b + c.  Hence (a + d) + (e + f) < (b + c) + (e + f), and therefore (a + e) + (d + f) < (b + f) + (c + e).  It follows by Axiom 8 that z(a + e, b + f) < z(c + e, d + f), and hence z(a, b) + z(e, f) < z(c, d) + z(e, f), which means that i + k < j + k.

  4. Let i, j, k ∈ ℤ, and suppose that i < j and k > 0.  There are some a, b, c, d, e, f ∈ ℕ such that i = z(a, b) and j = z(c, d) and k = z(e, f). So z(a, b) < z(c, d) and z(e, f) > 0, which means that a + d < b + c and f < e.  So by Lemma 10 we have
  
    (b + c)f + (a + d)e < (a + d)f + (b + c)e.

  Then
  
    (ae + bf) + (cf + de) < (af + be) + (ce + df).
    
  So z(ae + bf, af + be) < z(ce + df, cf + de) by Axiom 8.  And so z(a, b) · z(e, f) < z(c, d) · z(e, f), so we have ik < jk.

Theorem 20.  Let i, j ∈ ℤ.

  1. i > 0 if and only if -i < 0, and i < 0 if and only if -i > 0.
  2. 0 : ℤ < 1 : ℤ.
  3. If i ≤ j and j ≤ i, then i = j.
  4. If i > 0 and j > 0, then ij > 0.
  5. If i > 0 and j < 0, then ij < 0. 

# Divisibility

Definition.  For all a, b ∈ ℤ, a | b iff there is some c ∈ ℤ such that b = ac.

Theorem 21. For all a, b, c ∈ ℤ, if a | b and b | c then a | c.

Proof.  Let a, b, c : ℤ, and suppose that a | b and b | c.  There is some e ∈ ℤ such that ae = b.  Similarly, there is some f ∈ ℤ such that bf = c.  Hence c = bf = (ae)f = a(ef), and we conclude that a | c.

Theorem 22.  For all a, b, m, n, c ∈ ℤ, if c | a and c | b then c | (ma + nb).

Proof.  Let a, b, m, n, c : ℤ, and suppose that c | a and c | b.  There is some e ∈ ℤ such that a = ce.  Similarly, there is some f ∈ ℤ such that b = cf.  Hence ma + nb = mce + ncf = c(me + nf).  We see that c | (ma + nb).

# Prime numbers

Definition.  For all a ∈ ℤ, a is prime iff a > 1 and for all b ∈ ℤ, if b > 0 and b | a then b = 1 or b = a.
