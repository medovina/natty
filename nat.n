Axiom.  There exists a type ℕ with an element 0 ∈ ℕ and a function s : ℕ → ℕ such that

  a. There is no n ∈ ℕ such that s(n) = 0.
  b. For all n, m ∈ ℕ, if s(n) = s(m) then n = m.
  c. Let P : ℕ → 𝔹.  If P(0) is true, and P(k) implies P(s(k)) for all k ∈ ℕ, then P(n) is true for all n ∈ ℕ.

Definition.  Let 1 : ℕ = s(0).

Lemma.  Let a ∈ ℕ.  Suppose that a ≠ 0.  Then there is some b ∈ ℕ such that a = s(b).

Axiom.  There is a binary operation + : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ such that for all n, m ∈ ℕ,

  a. n + 0 = n.
  b. n + s(m) = s(n + m).

Theorem.  Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.

  1. If a + c = b + c, then a = b.
  2. (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).
  3. 0 + a = a = a + 0.
  4. s(a) + b = s(a + b).
  5. a + b = b + a.
  6. a + s(b) ≠ 0.
  7. a + s(b) ≠ a.
  8. If a + b = 0, then a = 0 and b = 0.

Axiom.  There is a binary operation · : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ such that for all n, m ∈ ℕ,

  a. n · 0 = 0.
  b. n · s(m) = (n · m) + n.

Theorem.  Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.

  1. a · 0 = 0 = 0 · a.
  2. a · 1 = a = 1 · a.
  3. c(a + b) = ca + cb.
  4. (ab)c = a(bc). 
  5. s(a) · b = ab + b.
  6. ab = ba.
  7. (a + b)c = ac + bc.
  8. If ab = 0 then a = 0 or b = 0.

Proof.

  4. Let a, b ∈ ℕ.  Let

        G = { x ∈ ℕ | (a · b) · x = a · (b · x) }.
  
  We have (ab) · 0 = 0 = a(b · 0), so 0 ∈ G.  Now let c ∈ ℕ, and suppose that c ∈ G.  Then

    (a · b) · s(c) = (a · b) · c + a · b
                   = a · (b · c) + a · b
                   = a · (b · c + b)
                   = a · (b · s(c)).
                 
  So s(c) ∈ G.  Hence x ∈ G for all x ∈ ℕ.

  5. Let a ∈ ℕ.  Let

        G = { x ∈ ℕ | s(a) · x = ax + x }.
    
  We have s(a) · 0 = 0 = a · 0 + 0, so 0 ∈ G.  Now let b ∈ ℕ, and suppose that b ∈ G.  Then

  s(a) · s(b) = s(a) · b + s(a)
              = (ab + b) + s(a)
              = ab + (b + s(a))
              = ab + s(b + a)
              = ab + s(a + b)
              = ab + (a + s(b))
              = (ab + a) + s(b)
              = a · s(b) + s(b).

  So s(b) ∈ G.  Hence x ∈ G for all x ∈ ℕ.

Theorem.  Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ.  If c ≠ 0 and ac = bc then a = b.

Proof. Let

        G = { x ∈ ℕ | for all y, z ∈ ℕ, if z ≠ 0 and xz = yz then x = y }.

  Let b, c ∈ ℕ with c ≠ 0 and 0 · c = bc. Then bc = 0.  Since c ≠ 0, we must have b = 0.  So 0 = b, and hence 0 ∈ G.

  Now let a ∈ ℕ, and suppose that a ∈ G.  Let b, c ∈ ℕ, and suppose that c ≠ 0 and s(a) · c = bc.  Then ca + c = bc.  If b = 0, then either s(a) = 0 or c = 0, which is a contradiction.  Hence b ≠ 0.  By Lemma 1 there is some p ∈ ℕ such that b = s(p).  Therefore ca + c = s(p) · c, and we see that ca + c = cp + c.  It follows that ca = cp, so ac = pc.  By hypothesis it follows that a = p.  Therefore s(a) = s(p) = b.  Hence s(a) ∈ G, and we deduce that x ∈ G for all x ∈ ℕ.
